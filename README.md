# odin-recipes

In this repository, this is the project for the recipe website using HTML. I will be making use of many HTML functions, such as:

Elements and tags, so how text can be displayed on a website.

Organising lists, both ordered and unordered. This helps when displaying information for different purposes.

Inserting links and images. I also will implement proper hyperlinking that allows for proper security, and functionality.

Enjoy!
