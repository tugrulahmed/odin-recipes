    <h2>How to cook Fried Chicken</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the buttermilk with salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic pwder, onion powder, and cayenne.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, ensuring it's fully coated. Cover and refrigerate for <strong>at least four hours,</strong> ideally overnight.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the coating</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, mix flour, cornstarch, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Coat the chicken</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the chicken from the buttermilk (let the excess drip off!)</li>
            <li>Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, pressing firmly to make sure the coating sticks.</li>
            <li>Let the coated chicken rest on a wire rack for <strong>10-15 minutes.</strong> This helps the crust hold up when frying.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Heat the Oil</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pour oil into a deep pan or fryer, heating to <strong>170-180 Celsius.</strong></li>
            <li>If you don't have a thermometer, drop a tiny bit of flour into the oil. It should sizzle but <strong>not burn!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Fry the Chicken</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fry in batches (don't overcrowd the pan) for <strong>10-12 minutes.</strong> Turn the chicken halfway until they become <strong>golden brown and crispy.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>REMEMBER!</strong> Thighs and Drumsticks take longer to cook (around 10-12 minutes) but wings cook for around 8-10 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Serve!</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place fried chicken on a <strong>wire rack</strong>, not a paper towel if you want it to stay crispy!</li>
            <li>Dig in and most of all... <strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>"Listen friend, if you want fried chicken that is crispy outside but juicy inside, you MUST marinate it properly! Buttermilk is the secret, yes? Let it bathe in it for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight. And when you are cooking them, rest them on a rack! Not paper towels! Otherwise it gets soggy. Your hands may be greasy, but your soul will be happy! Afiyet Olsun!"</em></h3>
